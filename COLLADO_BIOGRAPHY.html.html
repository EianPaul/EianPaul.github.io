  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <sup>1</sup>My name is <strong>Eian Paul A. Collado</strong> and luckily I was born in to this world at july 22,2001 at <i>Philippines Iba Zambles city</i>.<sup>2</sup>I have a father who supports my decision.
    <sup>3</sup>A mother who always make sure I do what is best.<sup>4</sup>After being borned my parents moved to another province called <i>Pampanga</i>.
    <sup>5</sup>After a few years my dad took me and my mom to <em>Dubai</em> to live with him.<sup>6</sup>I studied at <strong>United International Private School</strong>
    at dubai for 2 years but didn't really learned how much arabic language. <sup>7</sup>My days on dubai was the <strong>Happiest</strong> Experience I had.
    <sup>8</sup>Studying in dubai was so different here in philippines.<sup>9</sup>I use to ride school bus on my way to campus and if I miss the bus I had no choice but to stay at home.
    <sup>10</sup>But being honest I only like school bus when going home because i ride different school bus on my way home.<sup>11</sup>There I met my <dfn>first friend</dfn> who was a female but a year
    older than me.<sup>12</sup>Surprisingly we live in same apartment so we usually come hang and play together every after school and weekends.<sup>13</sup>The funny thing is that she is more
    manly back then.<sup>14</sup>She do all the hardwork for me and she even beat me on that category.<sup>15</sup>Sadly life is too young for me to control my life so we had to leave Dubai
    and go home back in the <strong>Philippines</strong>.
    <br><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>Living in the Philippines was like new to me again yet something i am used at the same time.
    <sup>17</sup>My life as an <dfn>elementary student</dfn> here in Philippines was rough for me because i get bullied alot for having <dfn> dark skin</dfn> and for being <dfn> fat</dfn>.
    <sup>18</sup>In this late childhood years my parents got separted due to unknown reason but i believed they seperated not because of lack of love but because they both are too focus on their goals.
    <sup>19</sup>Continuing my studies at <em> Pampanga </em> I started to join <strong>sport club</strong> but didn't really get to participate in interschools competition due to lack of dicipline.
    <sup>20</sup> My childhood academic story ends at my grade 7 year in Dominican School of Pampanga and later moved out to different school.

<!--TEENAGE CODE -->

<div class = "BoxTeenage">
  <h2><center><u><mark id = "mark">TEENAGE YEARS</mark></u></center></h2>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>After few years, on my grade 8<sup>th</sup> of my academic progress i moved out from my home to study at <em> Manila </em>.<sup>2</sup>I continued my studies at
    <strong>Sacred Heart of Jesus Catholic School</strong> wherein my life was about to change.<sup>3</sup> I became a type of student who is adventurous.<sup>4</sup> I had no fear living in the
    streets of <em>Manila</em> because i was full of excitement on how should I change my life.<sup>5</sup> I started first on my diet wherein i lost 15-20 kilos around my early teenage years and started
    to play <strong>Volleyball</strong> where later i became the team <em> Captain </em> of our school.<sup>6</sup> I started representing the school at my 9<sup>th</sup> grade
    but got eliminated on second round by <em>Cardinal School.</em><sup>6</sup> During my teenage years i live with my dad at <em> Sta.Mesa Manila Elpueblo Condominum </em> and during
    my stay with him i learned alot on handling our business.<sup>7</sup>Our business during my early teenage years was <strong>Perfume</strong> and we were doing well because
    of this business it helped me pay my tuition fee till i finish highschool.<sup>8</sup> During my highschool days I tend to help my dad on his business so i can call my self <em>"Productive"</em> but later on
    I learned how to mix some perfume ingredients on my own.<sup>9</sup> I was on peak on becoming a business man however I did not dedicate my time on our business because I believed that I wanted
    to continue playing volleyball till college and be a professional player.<sup>10</sup>The life of being athlete changed me drastically.<sup>11</sup>I forgot what to be a good moral human and live as a
    highschool athlete who doesn't study well.<sup>12</sup>I always get low grades during my junior highschool and used to get failing grades on science and math.
    <br><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup> Later on my 11<sup>th</sup> grade of highschool I changed my perspective on how i view life. I often ask my self <q>Does my country support athletes?</q>,<q>Can I help my parents
      with this career?</q>,<q>Will I be able to live a listless life?</q> and there is where I quit the volleyball club and began studying.<sup>14</sup> I took the track <strong>I.C.T</strong> program because I really had
      no other in mind what i wanted to become and since I hated math and speaking publicly I avoided the track HUMMS and STEM.<sup>15</sup>I talked to a close friend about my decision of leaving volleyball she often says to me
      <em>"It doesn't matter what other people thinks of you as long as you love what you feel"</em> and that is where I began to remove my peer pressure off my life.<sup>16</sup>During those times I studied alot to make my grades
      higher and it all worked out because I didn't have line of 7 in my grades.<sup>17</sup>On my free time I go to gym and train boxing just because I need to get my body to stay in shape.
      <br><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>18</sup> Then here comes the last
      year of my highschool.<sup>19</sup>On my 12 <sup>th</sup> year of highschool I talked to my ex teammate privately outside the condominum about how was our team doing.<sup>20</sup> Surprisingly they were doing good
      because I used to convince my self that I am the center of our team.<sup>21</sup> But after the talk i got convinced to play my last year of volleyball to represent our school.<sup>22</sup> I was doing it for a friend
      not for the school because the school and the staff don't really invest on athletes.<sup>23</sup>It was a tragic year for us because my friend dislocated his knee during warmup led by me so he wasn't able to
      play his last interchool.<sup>24</sup>I blamed my self for it by reason of pushing my teammates to their limits.
      <br><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <sup>25</sup>Later on my late moment of senior year a friend of mine got an idea to participate in the <strong>Anime Convention Event</strong> and participate as a cosplayer.
        <sup>26</sup> There is where I started my hobby to cosplay. <sup>27</sup> Cosplaying felt like i was able to become someone that i wanted to be back when I was a child.
         <sup>28</sup>It was a satisfying feeling and helped me cope to my problems back then.<sup>29</sup> My life as a highschool must come to end but must not forget how I build my self thru it.

<div class = "BoxCollege">
  <h2><center><u><mark id = "mark">COLLEGE YEARS</mark></u></center></h2>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <sup>1</sup> The continuation of my life is now on college.<sup>2</sup>I took the program <strong>BS IN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY </strong> at <em>University of the East Manila</em>.
      <sup>3</sup>Why I chose UE? well I have a cousin who also took <em>Information Technology</em> at the same university I enrolled in.<sup>4</sup> My dad also wanted me to attend this university
        so that after i graduate I'll have a good academic background at <em>Canada</em>. <sup>5</sup>My life as a college student is actually satisfying.<sup>6</sup> I avoid stressing my self by doing my hobbies like
        taking a jog often at night and playing games with friends.<sup>7</sup> At my first year of online class my cousine invited me if i was interested in joining an organizaion called <strong>COMSSO</strong>
        or known as <em>Computer Students Society</em>. <sup>8</sup>I started as assistant vice president in Internal Affairs.<sup>9</sup> During my year as AVP in internal i learned many techniques on how to
        start a project for webinars and to talk to some professionals IT graduate. <sup>10</sup> It was the begining of my change as a college student and not as a student athlete. <sup>11</sup> I had rough times
        on my firt year at COMSSO but surprisingly I made it along the way with the help of my co-officers.<sup>12</sup> They were first year like me and until now we are still at COMSSO.
        <sup>13</sup>Later on my second year as officer at COMSSO I was promotted to <strong>Executive Vice President</strong>.
        <br><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>I'm not just a college student I am currently also the assistant manager/Sales acquaintance at our business known as <strong>Fidel: Local Food Products</strong>.
        <sup>15</sup>On my free time I often work on our restaurant at cashier.<sup>16</sup>It's a rough day but in the end what matters is that I gained experience.
        <sup>16</sup>I'm not a smart student that's why I often rely on my experience and mistakes.<sup>17</sup>Giving up on my program degree was always not in my option because some friend of mine recently told me
        that <em>"Without hardwork you cannot learn"</em>.<sup>18</sup>Taking a step forward everyday is a progress and failing in quizes doesn't scare me.
        <sup>19</sup> Learning from a mistake is what matter in the end.<sup>20</sup>My journey as a College student is not yet over and i hope for the best in all of us.
