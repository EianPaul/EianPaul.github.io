    <h2><center><mark style = background-color:#2f2f1d;>SKILLS</mark></center></h2>
    <p><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  I'm a type of person who likes to learn new skills as long as I personally know that skill will help me
    reach something I want and that is to discover my dream thru it. My skills still requires some polishings
    and more practice. The development of my skills were not mine alone to discover. My parents and friends
    helped me have this skills and I was enable to put it in work to be more good at it.
    </p>
    <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the skills I acquired was <strong>customer sales as a sale apprentiece</strong>.
    Our business is about selling local food products here in NCR. I often help my dad at
    early start of the business when I was 17 Yearsold  and based on my experience I have
    interacted with many people that leds me to grow our sales. Years later
    Our business expand and started a restaurant that has two branch already.
    This skill helped me boost my confidence and get to have a hands on experience on interacting
    with the customers. Another marketing skills I gained from my experience is the <strong> Counter Register </strong>.
    I gained this skill because my dad teached me how to used a <em>POS</em> at our restaurant when
    Taking orders of the customers. This helped me developed my social anxiety and helped me to talk to people
    around me. I did encounter some mistakes during this job however I keep learning from it.
    Another skill I developed because of our business is the <strong>Social Media Content Creator</strong>.
    I make contents for the posting of updates at our business facebook page. I also reply to question that the customer inquires
    during on my free times. I learned this skill thru my self because back at highschool years I used to learn photoshop a bit
    as a hobby and now I am applying that technique to our business.
  </p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The majority of my skills and techniques came from our business. I did learn some skills here in the university
      but I could really not call them a skill yet because of the lack of knowledge I possess. For me, skill is something we nurture and love to do
      it is same as the hobby. I don't call it a skill until I apply it to where I am working on. The more we love doing it the more we
      enhance the skills.

   <h2><center><mark style = background-color:#2f2f1d;>HOBBIES</mark></center></h2>
   <p><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hobbies are something I love and enjoy doing. This helps me cope in stress and help be to be more feeling
     refreshed thru out the day. Listening to <strong>Music</strong> Is one of my hobbies. Whenever I sleep or getting warm up for my sport games I always put on the
     headset/earphone and scroll to my list of songs. Music is like having communication with your self because it helps me understand my mood.What do i mean
     by that? I mean it like music guides me. The feeling of Happiness,Sadness,Pain,Sleepy and adrenaline rush is a human factor to us and music helps me to cope with it.
     Another one of my hobbies is playing<strong>Volleyball</strong>. I used to be a student athlete because of volleyball and this sport really changed my life.
     I started eating healthy and taking care of my mind & body. This hobby of mine is not alone because without the people who surrounded me in the past i wouldn't be
     interested in playing sports. Sport was the major <em>factor</em> of my academic progress. Why you ask? well, it helped me to learn how to balance my
     academics work and athletic works which cause me to learn how to manage my time. even now i still countinue to play volleyball every weekends.Another one
     of my favorite hobbies is <strong>Anime</strong> in general. What do I mean in general? Majority of what I do in my hobby revolved around in the <strong>anime industry</strong>.
     I often listen to their musics and watch alot of anime since my 1st grade. Years later on my highschool age my friend and I started attending anime events
     and we even cosplayed as a start of our new hobby. The feeling of becoming one of your favorite characters is just fun and at the same time you get the satisfaction
     feeling when the fans love your cosplay.
   </p>

   <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These hobbies of mine is something I do not enjoy alone. What i notice is that people influence me to have this hobbies and I don't regret
     being influenced by them. <q>As long as you like something we don't need to be shy in it</q>. This was quoted by my friend along time ago and since then I always say with
     smile on my face if they asked me what is my hobby.

       <br><br><br>

  <h2><center><mark style = background-color:#2f2f1d;>INTEREST</mark></center></h2>

  <p><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Interest is the very first thing on why I had these skills, hobbies and knowledge. <q>What is this?</q>, <q>How is this?</q>, <q>When is this?</q>
    The question we ask when we are interested in a idea or things. My interest built me for who I am today. This is because I always try what makes me interest. The skills I have
    didn't happened to have it instantly. It happened that I have those skills because of my interest of learning it. <strong>Music</strong> became interesting because of the instrument being played.
    Like in anime songs I don't understand nihongo but I do like their music because the instruments and the beats are very interesting and amusing to listen to. Volleyball is interesting
    because of the social in it. I play for the adrenaline and the fun of it which makes it interesting. There were times i lost interest in being a student athlete but it came back
    after a few months. Business was something I'm not fond of because I have zero interest on money and making profits. But since i started college I became so interested
    in helping running our business because I became interested on who i want to be after college. Interest is something i cannot force but it is something that will
    come to me sooner or later. A person who has interesting idea also makes me interested in their vibes. I hang with people who can have positive influence in me because
    they are the one who shapes me up to become someone in the future.
